## Nextra

docs is highly inspired by Nextra. For example, the Routing Conventions. That is why
`meta.json` also exists in docs.

Nextra is more opinionated than docs, as a side effect, you have to
configure things manually compared to simply editing a configuration file.

docs works great if you want more control over everything, such as
adding it to an existing codebase or implementing advanced routing.

## Mintlify

Mintlify is a documentation service, as compared to docs, it offers a free tier but isn't completely free and open source.

docs is not as powerful as Mintlify, for example, the OpenAPI integration of Mintlify.
As the creator of docs, I wouldn't recommend switching to docs from Mintlify if you're satisfied with the current way you build docs.
However, I believe docs is a suitable tool for all React.js developers who want to have elegant docs.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a powerful framework based on React.js. It offers many cool
features with plugins and custom themes.

### Lower Complexity

As docs is designed to integrate with React frameworks, you may need more knowledge of React.js to get started.
In return, docs have better customizability.

For a simple docs, Docusaurus might be a better choice if you don't need any framework-specific functionality.

### Plugins

You can easily achieve many things with plugins, their ecosystem is indeed larger and maintained by many contributors.

In comparison, the flexibility of docs allows you to implement them on your own, it may take longer to tune it to your satisfaction.
